  ## Description
  This app allows the user to write and save notes. Using Express back end this app will save and retrieve note date from a JSON file.

  As required by the assignment, I included the `db.json` file and created the HTML and API routes.

  ## Tools
  To create this app I used the following tools:
  * Express
  * JQuery
  * Bootstrap
  * Heroku 

  ## Deployment
  
  Once I had created the app on the local host, I proceeded  to deploying the app on Heroku. Using the terminal within VS code, I logged into my heroku account and then ran `heroku create` which adds Heroku as a repository.

  I then checked my package.json to ensure that I had my `start` script and all other dependencies. I also ensured that my server was starting on a dynamic port.

  Once I confirmed all of this, I ran `git push heroku main` and my app was then pushed to me heroku account where I was able to access my app.

  Please see below for a demo of the deployed app and the deployed link
